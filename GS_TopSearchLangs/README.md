This script is for getting the top search languages for Global Search.
Obviously you need the data from Alma/Primo, so talk to the admins in order to get a file.

The file may be provided in Excel format, in which case simply open it in Excel, make a clean sheet with just the table of data, and save that as a CSV file.

#Note: The CSV file must be placed in the same directory folder as the R Project!
