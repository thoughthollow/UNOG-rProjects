# Get the languages of the various LibAnswers fields

This script is for getting the top search languages ticket in LibAnswers. Obviously you need the data from the system, so talk to the admins if you don't have access.
This script presumes the export is CSV and not the JSON option.

#Note: The CSV file must be placed in the same directory folder as the R Project!
